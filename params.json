So stupid you probably don't even want to look at it. Seriously.\r\n* [rank-es](https://github.com/rinze/rank-es). Takes links from the front page / pending page from meneame.net (a digg/reddit clone in Spanish) and re-ranks them using the likes and shares scores from Facebook and Twitter. Effectively, it builds a news aggregator site without users. You can see it action at http://rank-es.appspot.com/, running on the Google cloud.\r\n* [kiva-secular](https://github.com/rinze/kiva_secular). Filters [Kiva](http://kiva.org) field partners according to their secular and social scores computed by [this team](http://www.kiva.org/team/atheists). This is a very old project with a very basic structure, but was one of the first things I did when learning Python. Results refreshed hourly at http://www.eurielec.etsit.upm.es/~chema/kiva_secular/ when the university servers are up. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
